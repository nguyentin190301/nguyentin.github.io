I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD), fortunately advised by [Prof. Hal Daumé III](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/) and [Prof. Zubin Jelveh](https://zjelveh.github.io/), who care and foster conceptual creativity. My research interests include AI fairness, trustworthiness, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and law. My currently most focused research direction is law-informed fairness, including but not limited to two broad questions:
1. How to identify the current stances and knowledge gaps of heterogeneous legal sources that regulate a. AI in general, and b. the fairness of AI-involved decision-making processes in particular?
2. How to design new concepts, technical experiments, and/or human studies to address those law-informed AI fairness knowledge gaps while minimizing disruptiveness to existing legal principles?
