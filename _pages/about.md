I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD), fortunately advised by [Prof. Hal Daum√© III](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/) and [Prof. Zubin Jelveh](https://zjelveh.github.io/), who care and foster conceptual creativity. My research interests lie at the intersection of algorithmic fairness, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and law. My currently most focused research direction is law-informed fairness, including but not limited to two broad questions:
1. How to identify the current stances and knowledge gaps of heterogeneous legal sources that regulate a. AI in general, and b. the fairness of AI-involved decision-making processes in particular?
2. How to design new concepts, technical experiments, and/or human studies to address those law-informed AI fairness knowledge gaps while minimizing disruptiveness to existing legal principles?
